				<h2>About This Site</h2>
				<br>
				<h4>This site has been created as the project assignment for
					the Yeovil College level 5 Computing course.</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					The purpose of the site is to show what it is possible for
					foundation degree students to create using freely available
					technologies. This site required several programming languages to
					realise, all of which have been learned during the course. The
					project is the work of three students; <strong>Jake Lewis</strong>,
					<strong>Matthew Rayner</strong>, and <strong>Myric Allen</strong>.
					We hope that this site demonstrates the potential skills that could
					be learned by a student of the course.

		<h3>Tomcat Catalina</h3>
		<p>The servlet container for our server, this allows us to use
			Java Servlet Pages (JSP) so that we can dynamically load parts of a
			page</p>
		<h3>Tomcat WebSocket</h3>
		<p>A Tomcat API that allows us to use WebSockets in our site,
			these allow two-way communication between the front-end and the
			server</p>
		<h3>JSON</h3>
		<p>Short for JavaScript Object Notation, it's used to pass certain
			data between the front-end and the servers in a neat, object-oriented
			fashion</p>
