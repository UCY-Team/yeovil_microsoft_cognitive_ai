				<h2>About This Site</h2>
				<br>
				<h4>This site has been created as the project assignment for
					the Yeovil College level 5 Computing course.</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					The purpose of the site is to show what it is possible for
					foundation degree students to create using freely available
					technologies. This site required several programming languages to
					realise, all of which have been learned during the course. The
					project is the work of three students; <strong>Jake Lewis</strong>,
					<strong>Matthew Rayner</strong>, and <strong>Myric Allen</strong>.
					We hope that this site demonstrates the potential skills that could
					be learned by a student of the course.
